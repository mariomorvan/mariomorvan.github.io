Welcome here

I graduated with both a Dipl. Ing. from Mines Saint-Etienne School and a MSci in Astrophysics from the University of Barcelona. While in the former I specialized in Data Science and Big Data, I later had the opportunity to apply these skills to astronomical data during my research project at the UB, developing a new method to detect open clusters from Gaia measurements. Seduced then by the combination of Machine Learning and Astronomy which, I realized, would continue to flourish in the near future due to the upcoming massive astronomical surveys, this CDT seemed to me like the perfect next step, and I therefore joined it after 8 months working in a Data Consultancy company in Paris.
